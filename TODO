switch to flaotoat3 
switch to half aligned to 8 and check difference in perf
change to cooperative groups
change to arbitrary number of warps
switch to managed memory
gpu_heatmap_chromosome_boundaries into constant memory
add operational space for GPU to do its half operations there and then in the end copy everything to float space
heatmap_dist to constant / texture
clean up register usage
line 125 reference considereation
consider threadfence_system
clusters_fixed to constant memory
N is defined as a constant
ensure that warpsize is 32 for loop unrolling
refresh random
separate kernel for copying float space -> half space and then another one for half space -> float space
